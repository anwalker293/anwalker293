Hi! I'm Alex, a Software Engineer at Indicio and a Website Developer at Lake Grove Web Designs. I'm passionate about helping businesses shine online with fast, stunning, and high-performing websites. 

In my professional work, I've been fortunate to contribute to open-source projects, like building the 'aries-akrida' repository for the Government of British Columbia and supporting the development of Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py). Most of my work, however, focuses on proprietary projects at Indicio, particularly on their Proven product.

At Willamette University, I built a solid foundation in physics, mathematics, and politics, which deepened my technical skills and feature implementation capabilities. My academic journey also led me through diverse research projects, from predicting spiral galaxy inclinations with machine learning to studying graph theory and exploring social issues like the poverty-to-prison pipeline in Oregon.
